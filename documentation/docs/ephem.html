<h1>Solar Ephemeris Node</h1>
<p>Calculates current solar position relative to SeaSTAR on the sky.</p>
<p><a href='../index.html'>Return home</a></p>
<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: In the building we get really crappy GPS signal which causes fake wandering, so the location of SeaSTAR has been temporarily HARD-CODED IN. To change this, go to solar_ephemeris/solar_ephemeris/solar_ephemeris.py. Comment out line 27, which contains the hard-coded position, and uncomment out line 28, which uses the navsatfix location.</p>

<h4>Published topics</h4>
