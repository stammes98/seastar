<body>
<h1>Motor State Manager Node</h1>
<p>Handles motor connections in pairs of 2. Indexing from zero, each pair of motors will listen to commands and publish its position on numbered topics. </p>
<p><a href='../index.html'>Return home</a></p>
<p>Motor kinematics restrains are stored in motor_state_manager/include/motorsettings.cfg</p>

<h4>Subscribed topics</h4>
<ul>
<li>"/motor_commands" - a string formatted as "MOTOR_INDEX V1,V2" which sets velocities of each pair.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Published topics</h4>
<ul>
<li>"/motorsN" - N is index of motor pair. Publishes positions of motor pair in stepper space.</li>
</ul>
</body>

<p>Special notes: Sometimes the ports get confused because of the IMU. Line 29 of motor_state_manager.cpp should work in its current state, however if the IMU is changed, or the order of motor connections changes, so will this</p>
