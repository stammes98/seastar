<h1>IK Tools Node</h1>
<p>A bit of a misnomer, the IK Tools Node subscribes to a few auxilary topics and publishes a few auxilary topics to assist with sun tracking. Uses same ik_helper.py script as ik_tools to compute inverse Jacobian of robot, publishing motor velocity commands in response to the sunspot topic and motor state topics</p>
<p><a href='../index.html'>Return home</a></p>

<h4>Topics subscribed</h4>
<ul>
<li>"/motors0" - contains positions of roll and pitch motors</li>
<li>"/motors1" - contains position of stokes motor and will contain future sun-plate motor</li>

<li>"/sunspot" - position on the sun tracking camera the brightest pixel is at</li>
</ul>

<h4>Topics published</h4>
<ul>
<li>"/robot_ephemeris" - contains point on the sky the robot thinks it's pointing at based on IK and the IMU. Will drift with IMU error</li>
<li>"/inv_jacobian" - velocity commands based on inverse jacobian method to move the camera towards the published sun spot topic. </li>
</ul>
