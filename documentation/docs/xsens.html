<h1>Xsens Node</h1>
<p>This node runs the Xsens IMU and publishes the data over ros. Code was untouched from version provided to Steve at start of summer. Any changes that need to be made to the xsens IMU should be done with their MT software, available on this machine at /home/seastar/Downloads/MT_Software_Suite_linux-x64_2022.0_b7085_r119802/MT_Software_Suite_linux-x64_2022.0/mtmanager_linux-x64_2022.0/mtmanager/linux-x64/bin/mtmanager
